## What is a Life Insurance Beneficiary?

A **life insurance beneficiary** is the person, people, or entity you designate to receive your policy's death benefit when you pass away. Choosing your beneficiaries is one of the most important decisions you'll make when purchasing life insurance.

While it may seem straightforward, there are important considerations and potential pitfalls to avoid.

## Primary vs. Contingent Beneficiaries

### Primary Beneficiaries

Your **primary beneficiaries** are the first in line to receive the death benefit. You can name multiple primary beneficiaries and specify what percentage each should receive.

**Example:**

- Spouse: 50%
- Adult Child 1: 25%
- Adult Child 2: 25%

### Contingent Beneficiaries

**Contingent beneficiaries** (also called secondary beneficiaries) only receive the death benefit if all primary beneficiaries have predeceased you or are unable to claim the benefit.

Think of contingent beneficiaries as your backup plan.

## Who Can You Name as a Beneficiary?

You can name almost anyone or any entity as your beneficiary:

- **Individuals**: Spouse, children, parents, siblings, friends, domestic partners
- **Organizations**: Charities, non-profits, religious organizations
- **Trusts**: A trust you've established
- **Your estate**: Though this is generally not recommended (see below)

### Minor Children as Beneficiaries

You **can** name minor children as beneficiaries, but there are complications:

- Minors cannot directly receive insurance proceeds
- A court-appointed guardian or trust may be required to manage the funds
- This can delay payout and create legal costs

**Better Option**: Create a trust or name a trusted adult guardian as beneficiary to manage funds for your children.

## Common Beneficiary Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Naming Your Estate as Beneficiary

❌ **Why it's problematic:**

- Proceeds become subject to probate (expensive and time-consuming)
- Money can be claimed by creditors
- Distribution is delayed while estate is settled
- No privacy - becomes part of public record

✅ **Better approach:** Name specific individuals or a trust

### 2. Forgetting to Update After Life Changes

Life events that should trigger a beneficiary review:

- **Marriage or divorce**
- Birth or adoption of children
- Death of a beneficiary
- Changes in financial circumstances
- Falling out with a named beneficiary

Failing to update beneficiaries is one of the most common mistakes. Your ex-spouse could receive your death benefit if you forget to update after divorce.

### 3. Not Naming Contingent Beneficiaries

If your primary beneficiary predeceases you and you haven't named a contingent beneficiary, the death benefit may go to your estate (see problem #1 above).

### 4. Being Too Vague

Avoid vague designations like "my children" without specifics. What if you have more children later? What if one child predeceases you?

✅ **Be specific**: Name individuals with identifying information (full name, date of birth, relationship)

### 5. Not Coordinating with Your Will

Your life insurance beneficiary designation **overrides your will**. Even if your will says everything goes to your spouse, if your beneficiary designation says your brother, the insurance proceeds go to your brother.

## Special Situations to Consider

### Blended Families

If you have children from a previous marriage and a current spouse, consider:

- Using a trust to ensure both spouse and children are provided for
- Clearly specifying percentages to each party
- Discussing your plans with all parties to avoid surprises

### Beneficiaries with Special Needs

If your beneficiary receives government benefits (SSI, Medicaid), a direct inheritance could disqualify them from these programs.

**Solution**: Establish a **Special Needs Trust** as the beneficiary to preserve their eligibility while providing financial support.

### Pet Care

While you cannot name pets as direct beneficiaries, you can:

- Name a trusted person with the understanding they'll care for your pet
- Set up a pet trust
- Leave funds to an animal welfare organization

## Tax Considerations

**Good news**: Life insurance death benefits are generally **not subject to federal income tax** for beneficiaries.

**However**, there are exceptions:

- If you transfer ownership of your policy within 3 years of death
- If proceeds are paid to your estate, they may be subject to estate taxes
- Interest earned on delayed payouts is taxable

**Pro tip**: For large policies, consult with an estate planning attorney to minimize tax implications.

## Per Stirpes vs. Per Capita

When naming multiple beneficiaries, you can specify:

### Per Stirpes ("By Branch")

If a beneficiary predeceases you, their share goes to their descendants.

**Example**: You name your two children as 50/50 beneficiaries. One child predeceases you but has two children. Those grandchildren split their parent's 50% share.

### Per Capita ("By Head")

If a beneficiary predeceases you, their share is split equally among surviving beneficiaries.

**Example**: Same scenario, but the entire death benefit is split 50/50 between your surviving child and the two grandchildren (25% each).

## How to Update Your Beneficiaries

1. **Contact your insurance company** or agent
2. **Request a change of beneficiary form**
3. **Complete the form** with full legal names and identifying information
4. **Submit to your insurer** - keep a copy for your records
5. **Confirm the change** in writing

**Do NOT** try to change beneficiaries in your will - it won't work. Changes must be made through the insurance company's official process.

## Beneficiary Checklist
