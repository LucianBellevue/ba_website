## What is Final Expense Insurance?

Final expense insurance, also known as burial insurance or funeral insurance, is a type of whole life insurance policy specifically designed to cover end-of-life expenses. Unlike traditional life insurance policies that may offer hundreds of thousands in coverage, final expense policies typically range from **$2,500 to $35,000**.

This type of insurance provides peace of mind by ensuring your loved ones won't be burdened with funeral costs, medical bills, or other final expenses after you pass away.

## Why Do Seniors Need Final Expense Insurance?

The average funeral in the United States costs between **$7,000 and $12,000**, and that doesn't include:

- Cemetery plots and burial costs
- Headstones or grave markers
- Medical bills not covered by Medicare
- Outstanding debts
- Probate and estate settlement costs

Without proper planning, these expenses can create significant financial hardship for grieving families.

## Key Benefits of Final Expense Insurance

### 1. Guaranteed Acceptance

Many final expense policies offer **guaranteed issue** options, meaning you cannot be denied coverage regardless of your health condition. This is ideal for seniors with pre-existing conditions who might not qualify for traditional life insurance.

### 2. Fixed Premiums

Your monthly premium stays the same for life. You'll never face a rate increase due to age or health changes once your policy is issued.

### 3. No Medical Exam Required

Most final expense policies use simplified underwriting with just a few health questions. No blood tests, no doctor visits, no invasive medical exams.

### 4. Fast Approval

Many applicants receive same-day approval and immediate coverage, giving you peace of mind right away.

### 5. Cash Value Accumulation

As a whole life policy, final expense insurance builds cash value over time that you can borrow against if needed.

## How Much Coverage Do You Need?

Consider these typical final expense costs when determining your coverage amount:

- **Funeral services**: $5,000 - $8,000
- **Casket**: $2,000 - $5,000
- **Burial plot**: $1,000 - $4,000
- **Headstone**: $1,000 - $3,000
- **Additional expenses**: $2,000 - $5,000

Most people choose coverage between **$10,000 and $15,000** to ensure all bases are covered.
